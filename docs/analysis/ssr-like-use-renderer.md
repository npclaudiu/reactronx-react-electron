# Analysis: `"use renderer"` Directive and SSR-like Direction

## Summary

The proposed `"use renderer"` directive is a viable direction for Reactronx **if scoped as a module-partitioning and
execution-boundary feature**, not as full web-style SSR.

For Electron, the strongest model is:

- Main process React tree remains the control plane for native resources.
- Renderer-marked modules become a separate renderer bundle and execute in web context.
- Data crosses boundaries through explicit, typed IPC contracts.

This can work well, but it raises framework complexity substantially. The core risk is turning a clear architecture
(main-driven reconciler) into a partially implicit dual-runtime system that is hard to reason about.

## What the Proposal Means

`"use renderer"` (analogous to `"use client"` in Next.js) would mark a module as renderer-only. Build tooling would:

- detect directive-marked modules,
- split dependency graphs into main/runtime-safe and renderer/runtime-safe partitions,
- emit renderer bundle entries automatically,
- inject references/handles into main-side tree so renderer modules can be mounted or invoked.

## Why This Is Attractive

- Preserves Reactronx identity (React controls Electron resources in main).
- Enables interactive UI logic to live where it belongs (renderer).
- Offers a cleaner mental model than ad-hoc separate frontend toolchains for simple apps.

## Core Engineering Challenges

1. Graph partitioning and boundary safety: main-only modules must never leak into renderer bundles; renderer-only
   modules must not import Node/Electron-main-only APIs.

2. Serialization and contract design: props/state/events crossing main <-> renderer must be serializable and versioned.

3. Runtime lifecycle coupling: window creation, renderer mount timing, preload bridge readiness, and hot reload behavior
   become tightly coupled.

4. Debuggability: errors can originate in compile partitioning, preload, IPC transport, main reconciler, or renderer
   runtime.

5. Security posture: feature design must not encourage bypassing preload isolation or broad IPC exposure.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- Clear product differentiation from conventional Electron setups.
- Strong fit for multi-window desktop workflows controlled from main.
- Potentially lower integration friction than mixing multiple external toolchains.
- Consistent developer ergonomics if directives and boundaries are enforced well.

### Weaknesses

- Considerably higher implementation and maintenance complexity.
- Increased cognitive load for users (two runtimes with one React mental model).
- Harder debugging across build-time partitioning and runtime IPC boundaries.
- Greater chance of subtle regressions during framework evolution.

### Opportunities

- Define a robust “desktop React server/components-like” pattern specialized for Electron.
- Provide strong compile-time diagnostics for boundary violations (major DX advantage).
- Offer first-class typed IPC generation from module boundaries.
- Enable opinionated app scaffolding/CLI workflows that can outperform DIY Electron setups.

### Threats

- Competes with mature ecosystems (Electron Forge + Vite + React, Tauri, web-first stacks).
- Incorrect abstraction can create performance/security footguns at scale.
- If boundary rules feel magical or inconsistent, adoption confidence drops quickly.
- Long-term maintenance burden may outpace small-team capacity.

## Recommendation

Proceed, but **do not market this as Next.js-style SSR first**. Instead, position it as:

- Runtime partitioning with explicit directives (`"use renderer"`),
- deterministic main/renderer boundaries,
- typed IPC-backed interactions.

Treat “SSR-like” behavior as a later emergent capability, not the initial product promise.

## Suggested Guardrails (Go/No-Go Criteria)

Ship only when all are true:

1. Static boundary checks: build fails on forbidden imports across main/renderer boundaries with actionable messages.

2. Deterministic bundling: same module graph always produces the same partitioning outputs.

3. Typed transport contracts: no implicit `any`-like payload paths across boundaries.

4. Security defaults: preload-only bridge exposure with allowlisted channels and least privilege.

5. Debug tooling: clear source maps, boundary traces, and error origin tagging (main/preload/renderer/build).

## Practical Phased Plan

1. Phase 1: `"use renderer"` directive detection + compile-time boundary enforcement + renderer bundle emission.

2. Phase 2: typed IPC bridge generation for directive boundaries.

3. Phase 3: developer experience layer (error overlays, boundary diagnostics, template scaffolding).

4. Phase 4: optional higher-level “SSR-like” primitives after runtime boundaries prove stable.

## Bottom Line

This direction is strategically sound **if implemented as strict runtime partitioning first**.  
It is unsound if attempted immediately as broad SSR parity with web frameworks.
